# Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) Gene Expression Analysis 
## Overview

Inflammatory Bowel Disease (IBD) is a chronic and complex gastrointestinal condition that presents a significant global health challenge due to its varying prevalence across different regions. IBD encompasses Crohn’s disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC), both of which involve persistent inflammation of the gastrointestinal tract. While Crohn’s disease can affect any part of the tract, ulcerative colitis primarily targets the colon and rectum.

Genomic research plays a crucial role in understanding the underlying genetic factors contributing to IBD, aiding in the diagnosis of patients with rare disease variants. This study leverages microarray sequencing to analyze gene expression data, shedding light on molecular mechanisms associated with IBD pathogenesis.

## Data Source

This study utilizes publicly available gene expression profiles obtained from the NCBI-GEO database:

Dataset ID: GSE6731

Conditions: Normal, Crohn’s disease (CD), Ulcerative colitis (UC)

Technology: Microarray sequencing

## Key Objectives

Extract and analyze gene expression values for Normal, UC, and CD conditions.

Identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs) across disease conditions.

Conduct correlation analysis to explore relationships between DEGs, inflammatory biomarkers, and disease-specific conditions.

Provide insights into potential therapeutic targets for precision medicine approaches.

## Methodology

### Data Extraction:

Retrieved raw expression values from GSE6731 dataset.

Processed data using R-based bioinformatics workflows.

Differential Gene Expression Analysis:

Identified 9,156 differentially expressed genes across conditions.

Constructed a design matrix to categorize disease phenotypes.

## Correlation Analysis:

Analyzed gene relationships with inflammatory biomarkers in affected tissues.

Mapped associations between gene expression levels and disease severity.

## Significance

This study integrates genomic data analysis, microarray sequencing, and correlation modeling to enhance our understanding of IBD at the molecular level. By identifying key genes linked to Crohn’s disease and ulcerative colitis, this research contributes to the development of targeted therapies and personalized treatment strategies for IBD management.
